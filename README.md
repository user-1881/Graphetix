<h1>GraphetiX</h1>
GraphetiX, a user-friendly library tailored specifically for learning purposes. GraphetiX simplifies the creation, modification, and analysis of graphs, making it easier for novices to explore graph theory concepts. It supports key operations on specific graph types, such as simple, directed, and weighted graphs, and includes conversion features that help users learn about graph types by understanding their differences. However, these features are limited to the mentioned graph types and do not apply to others. By offering tools for tasks like finding shortest paths, building efficient networks, and managing resources, GraphetiX bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. With its intuitive design and focus on education, GraphetiX serves as an accessible gateway for learners to grasp the fundamentals of graph theory and its growing relevance in solving real-world problems.
