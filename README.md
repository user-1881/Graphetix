<h1>GraphetiX</h1>
GraphetiX is a library of graph algorithms that will function as a flexible tool for interacting with various graph kinds. The library will provide various methods like executing key graph operations such as finding the shortest path between two nodes,
graph traversal,finding shortest distance between two nodes and many more. We will be working with different types of graph like-
a) Simple GraphFunctionalities
b) Complete GraphFunctionalities
c) Weighted GraphFunctionalities
d) Directed GraphFunctionalities
e) Undirected GraphFunctionalities
f) Connected GraphFunctionalities
g) Disconnected GraphFunctionalities
h) Cyclic GraphFunctionalities
i) Acyclic GraphFunctionalities
j) Directed Acyclic GraphFunctionalities etc.
We will also work with different graph search theories such as-
a) Breadth First Search (BFS)
B) Depth First Search (DFS)
We intend to implement this project using Java in IntelliJ.
